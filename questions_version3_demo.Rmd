**Guiding questions:**

-   Do any of the percentages of students in the course surprise you? In what way?
-   Given the demographic breakdown of your course, are there any changes or groups you would be specifically interested in examining course outcomes for?
-   Do you think it could be useful to show the demographic breakdown to your students? How might you present this data to your students?

## How have these demographics changed over time?

```{r demographics over time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

**Guiding questions:**

-   What groups, if any, are growing in the classroom in recent years?
-   Are there any change to the classroom course content or structure that could better meet the needs or specific challenges of these groups?

# Grades in this course

## How do course outcomes compare for different student groups?

```{r raw grades ~ identity}
#different identities with raw grades on average across identities 

#calculate overall mean grade for course (will be plotted as an average line)
mean_grade_coi <- mean(dat$numgrade[dat$crs_name == course_of_interest], na.rm = T)

dat %>%
  filter(crs_name == course_of_interest) %>%
  #pivot to a long format dataframe
  pivot_longer(cols = c(ethniccode_cat, female, firstgen, lowincomeflag, international, transfer), 
               names_to = "demo_var",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  #select all students who do belong to the group of interest
  filter(value == 1 ) %>%
  #rename labels to be more interpretable
  mutate(demo_var = factor(demo_var, 
                           labels = c("PEER", "Woman", "FirstGen", "LowIncome", "International", "Transfer"))) %>%
  add_count(demo_var, name = "n") %>%
  #PLOT
  ggplot(aes(x = demo_var, y = numgrade, color = demo_var)) + 
  #points for mean
  stat_summary(aes(size = n), geom = "point", fun = "mean") + 
  #add 95% CI errorbars
  stat_summary(geom = "errorbar", fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", width = 0.1) + 
  #plot average line for mean grade
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_grade_coi, linetype = "dashed") +
  #labels
  labs(x = "Student identity", y = "Average grade", color = "Student identity",
       caption = "Mean ± 95% CI shown \n Dashed line is overall average grade") + 
  theme_bw()
```

However, means and standard errors only tell part of the story. We can also examine the full distribution of the grades for each identity. The plot below shows the distribution (density plot), with the majority (25th - 75th percentiles) shaded in the darker color. Means are plotted as points along with standard errors.

## How does overall prior performance at the university (i.e., GPAO, prior GPA) compare to student outcomes in my course?

One way we can compare outcomes in our course to students' prior performance at our institution is by calculating **grade anomaly**. Grade anomaly subtracts a measure of student's general or prior academic performance, such as prior GPA, from their course grade.

Grade anomalies can be:

-   **Grade penalties** - where students receive *lower* grades in the course relative to their other coursework, or,

-   **Grade bonuses** - where students receive *higher* grades relative to other courses.

SEISMIC projects often use grade point average omitting the course of interest (**GPAO**), because this metric has been found to be the best metric of prior academic preparation in previous studies (compared to high school GPA or standardized test scores, [Koester et al.,2016](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.07565)). GPAO can also be especially useful for transfer students, who may not have a prior GPA at our institution if they just transferred.

```{r grade anomaly ~ identity}
#different identities with average grade anomaly across identities 

#calculate overall mean grade for course (will be plotted as an average line)
aga_coi <- mean(dat$numgrade[dat$crs_name == course_of_interest], na.rm = T) -

**Guiding questions:**

-   Are students receiving a grade bonus or a grade penalty on average in this course? (see dashed line for overall course average)
-   Are there any marginalized demographic groups that are receiving more of a grade penalty or more of a grade bonus? Reflecting on the course structure and its place in the curriculum context, can you think of any reasons that might be?

## How do course outcomes differ across the spectrum of systemic advantages students may have access to in higher education?

How can we view the cumulative effect of systemic advantages students may have access to (conferred by demographic identities) overall in the context of a course?

### SAI

SAI, or the **Systemic Advantage Index** is one approach. This metric takes into account multiple axes of student identities, including:

-   race/ethnicity

-   gender

-   socioeconomic status

-   parental education (i.e., first-generation college-going status)

SAI adds together all of the advantages a student may have across these four demographic axes and assigns an index. The table below shows SAI for multiple combinations of identities. For instance, a Latino, first-generation, low income man (column second from left) would be considered to have SAI = 1, while a white, continuing-generation woman from a high income family would be considered to have SAI = 3 (column second from right).

![](SAI_assignment.tif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 💭 Can you think of any other systemic advantages not included in this index that likely influence student's outcomes in a course? What would be the challenges to adding those identities or advantages to this index?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r SAI calculation}
#this code goes through all possible combinations of the 4 advantage axes and assigns an SAI based on that students' values
#as ethniccode_cat == 1 is the "BIPOC" label, all other categories are considered advantaged 
dat <-
  dat %>% mutate(sai = case_when(
    female == "0" & ethniccode_cat != "1" & firstgen == "0" & lowincomeflag == "0"  ~ "4",
    female == "1" & ethniccode_cat != "1" & firstgen == "0" & lowincomeflag == "0"  ~ "3",

```

### How do course grades and grade anomalies compare across levels of SAI?

The below plots show raw grades and grade anomaly partitioned by the number of systemic advantages students have access to.

**Guiding questions:**

-   Are different levels of SAI significantly different from each other in terms of course outcomes (i.e., do 95% confidence intervals overlap)? Is there a linear relationship between SAI and grade, or is the relationship more mixed? Is there a point where students fall "below" average grades or grade anomalies? How can we better serve those students in this course?

-   If we see differences across levels of SAI, what elements of the course structure might lead to some of these differences with student systemic advantages?
