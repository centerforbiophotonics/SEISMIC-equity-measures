# SEISMIC-equity-measures

**Goal**: Piloting an initial "menu" of equity measures for introductory STEM courses for the SEISMIC collaboration. Currently, the documents in this repository will guide institutional researchers (IRs) and data analysts through the process of preparing institutional data to generate equity reports for local SELC grant teams.

## Code Workflow for SELC IR Users

When using the code, SELC project institutional researchers should go through the following steps:

0.  (*Before working through code*) Determine what courses are of interest and get access to relevant institutional data.

1.  Prepare institutional data for use with the code by viewing and following the [Data Preparation Guide here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/vsfarrar/SEISMIC-equity-measures/blob/main/data_preparation_guide.html) (.html). This guide contains instructions for formatting the dataset and selecting the necessary variables to run the code.

2.  Check that your dataset has been formatted properly by downloading and working through the [Check Your Data guide](https://github.com/vsfarrar/SEISMIC-equity-measures/blob/main/check_your_data.Rmd) (.Rmd) in R.

3.  Run the SELC Level 1 R Markdown report (.Rmd) code and generate a report (.html) to share with stakeholders.
