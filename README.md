# SEISMIC-equity-measures
**Goal**: Piloting an initial "menu" of equity measures for intoductory STEM courses for the SEISMIC collaboration. Ideally, this list of equity measurements can be used by SEISMIC project members, the public, and for creating equity reports for the SELC grant.  

**Creators:** Victoria Farrar, Nita Tarchinski
